  "question": "Show that the relation R in the set {1, 2, 3} given by R = {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3)} is reflexive but neither symmetric nor transitive.",
  "solution": "R is reflexive, since (1, 1), (2, 2) and (3, 3) lie in R. Also, R is not symmetric, as (1, 2) $\\in$ R but (2, 1) $\\notin$ R. Similarly, R is not transitive, as (1, 2) $\\in$ R and (2, 3) $\\in$ R but (1, 3) $\\notin$ R."
