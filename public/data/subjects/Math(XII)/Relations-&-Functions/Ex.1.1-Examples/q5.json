  "question": "Show that the relation R in the set $\\mathbf{Z}$ of integers given by\n\n$R = \\{(a, b) : 2 \\text{ divides } a - b\\}$\n\nis an equivalence relation.",
  "solution": "R is reflexive, as 2 divides $(a - a)$ for all $a \\in \\mathbf{Z}$. Further, if $(a, b) \\in$ R, then 2 divides $a - b$. Therefore, 2 divides $b - a$. Hence, $(b, a) \\in$ R, which shows that R is symmetric. Similarly, if $(a, b) \\in$ R and $(b, c) \\in$ R, then $a - b$ and $b - c$ are divisible by 2. Now, $a - c = (a - b) + (b - c)$ is even (Why?). So, $(a - c)$ is divisible by 2. This shows that R is transitive. Thus, R is an equivalence relation in $\\mathbf{Z}$."
