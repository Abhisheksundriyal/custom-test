  "question": "Let R be the relation defined in the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} by\n\nR = {(a, b) : both $a$ and $b$ are either odd or even}. Show that R is an equivalence relation.\n\nFurther, show that all the elements of the subset {1, 3, 5, 7} are related to each\nother and all the elements of the subset {2, 4, 6} are related to each other, but no\nelement of the subset {1, 3, 5, 7} is related to any element of the subset {2, 4, 6}.",
  "solution": "Given any element $a$ in A, both $a$ and $a$ must be either odd or even, so that $(a, a) \\in$ R. Further, $(a, b) \\in$ R $\\Rightarrow$ both $a$ and $b$ must be either odd or even $\\Rightarrow$ $(b, a) \\in$ R. Similarly, $(a, b) \\in$ R and $(b, c) \\in$ R $\\Rightarrow$ all elements $a, b, c,$ must be either even or odd simultaneously $\\Rightarrow$ $(a, c) \\in$ R. Hence, R is an equivalence relation.\n\nFurther, all the elements of {1, 3, 5, 7} are related to each other, as all the elements of this subset are odd. Similarly, all the elements of the subset {2, 4, 6} are related to each other, as all of them are even. Also, no element of the subset {1, 3, 5, 7} can be related to any element of {2, 4, 6}, as elements of {1, 3, 5, 7} are odd, while elements of {2, 4, 6} are even."
