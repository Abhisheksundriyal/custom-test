  "solution": "(i) Let $A = \\{5, 6, 7\\}$.\n\nDefine a relation $R$ on $A$ as $R = \\{(5, 6), (6, 5)\\}$.\n\nRelation $R$ is not reflexive as $(5, 5), (6, 6), (7, 7) \\notin R$.\n\nNow, as $(5, 6) \\in R$ and also $(6, 5) \\in R$, $R$ is symmetric.\n\n⇒ $(5, 6), (6, 5) \\in R$, but $(5, 5) \\notin R$\n\n∴ $R$ is not transitive.\n\nHence, relation $R$ is symmetric but not reflexive or transitive.\n\n(ii) Consider a relation $R$ in $\\mathbf{R}$ defined as:\n\n$R = \\{(a, b) : a < b\\}$\n\nFor any $a \\in R$, we have $(a, a) \\notin R$ since $a$ cannot be strictly less than $a$ itself. In fact, $a = a$.\n\n∴ $R$ is not reflexive.\n\nNow,\n\n$(1, 2) \\in R$ (as $1 < 2$)\n\nBut, $2$ is not less than $1$.\n\n∴ $(2, 1) \\notin R$\n\n∴ $R$ is not symmetric.\n\nNow, let $(a, b), (b, c) \\in R$.\n\n⇒ $a < b$ and $b < c$\n\n⇒ $a < c$\n\n⇒ $(a, c) \\in R$\n\n∴ $R$ is transitive.\n\nHence, relation $R$ is transitive but not reflexive and symmetric.\n\n(iii) Let $A = \\{4, 6, 8\\}$.\n\nDefine a relation $R$ on $A$ as:\n\n$A = \\{(4, 4), (6, 6), (8, 8), (4, 6), (6, 4), (6, 8), (8, 6)\\}$\n\nRelation $R$ is reflexive since for every $a \\in A$, $(a, a) \\in R$ i.e., $(4, 4), (6, 6), (8, 8) \\in R$.\n\nRelation $R$ is symmetric since $(a, b) \\in R \\Rightarrow (b, a) \\in R$ for all $a, b \\in R$.\n\nRelation $R$ is not transitive since $(4, 6), (6, 8) \\in R$, but $(4, 8) \\notin R$.\n\nHence, relation $R$ is reflexive and symmetric but not transitive.\n\n(iv) Define a relation $R$ in $\\mathbf{R}$ as:\n\n$R = \\{(a, b) : a^3 \\geq b^3\\}$\n\nClearly $(a, a) \\in R$ as $a^3 = a^3$.\n\n∴ $R$ is reflexive.\n\nNow,\n\n$(2, 1) \\in R$ (as $2^3 \\geq 1^3$)\n\nBut,\n\n$(1, 2) \\notin R$ (as $1^3 < 2^3$)\n\n∴ $R$ is not symmetric.\n\nNow,\n\nLet $(a, b), (b, c) \\in R$.\n\n⇒ $a^3 \\geq b^3$ and $b^3 \\geq c^3$\n\n⇒ $a^3 \\geq c^3$\n\n⇒ $(a, c) \\in R$\n\n∴ $R$ is transitive.\n\nHence, relation $R$ is reflexive and transitive but not symmetric.\n\n(v) Let $A = \\{-5, -6\\}$.\n\nDefine a relation $R$ on $A$ as:\n\n$R = \\{(-5, -6), (-6, -5), (-5, -5)\\}$\n\nRelation $R$ is not reflexive as $(-6, -6) \\notin R$.\n\nRelation $R$ is symmetric as $(-5, -6) \\in R$ and $(-6, -5) \\in R$.\n\nIt is seen that $(-5, -6), (-6, -5) \\in R$. Also, $(-5, -5) \\in R$.\n\n∴ The relation $R$ is transitive.\n\nHence, relation $R$ is symmetric and transitive but not reflexive."
