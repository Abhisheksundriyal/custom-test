  "question": "Show that the relation $R$ in the set $A$ of points in a plane given by $R = \\{(P, Q): \\text{distance of point } P \\text{ from the origin is the same as the distance of the point } Q \\text{ from the origin}\\} $, is an equivalence relation. Further, show that the set of all point related to a point $P \\neq (0, 0)$ is the circle passing through $P$ with origin as centre.",
  "solution": "$R = \\{(P, Q): \\text{distance of point } P \\text{ from the origin is the same as the distance of point } Q \\text{ from the origin}\\} $\n\nClearly, $(P, P) \\in R$ since the distance of point $P$ from the origin is always the same as the distance of the same point $P$ from the origin.\n\n$\\therefore R$ is reflexive.\n\nNow,\n\nLet $(P, Q) \\in R$.\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ The distance of point $P$ from the origin is the same as the distance of point $Q$ from the origin.\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ The distance of point $Q$ from the origin is the same as the distance of point $P$ from the origin.\n\n$\\Rightarrow (Q, P) \\in R$\n\n$\\therefore R$ is symmetric.\n\nNow,\n\nLet $(P, Q), (Q, S) \\in R$.\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ The distance of points $P$ and $Q$ from the origin is the same and also, the distance of points $Q$ and $S$ from the origin is the same.\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ The distance of points $P$ and $S$ from the origin is the same.\n\n$\\Rightarrow (P, S) \\in R$\n\n$\\therefore R$ is transitive.\n\nTherefore, $R$ is an equivalence relation.\n\nThe set of all points related to $P \\neq (0, 0)$ will be those points whose distance from the origin is the same as the distance of point $P$ from the origin.\n\nIn other words, if $O (0, 0)$ is the origin and $OP = k$, then the set of all points related to $P$ is at a distance of $k$ from the origin.\n\nHence, this set of points forms a circle with the centre as the origin and this circle passes through point $P$."
