  "question": "Show that the relation R defined in the set A of all triangles as R = {(T$_{1}$, T$_{2}$): T$_{1}$ is similar to T$_{2}$}, is equivalence relation. Consider three right angle triangles T$_{1}$ with sides 3, 4, 5, T$_{2}$ with sides 5, 12, 13 and T$_{3}$ with sides 6, 8, 10. Which triangles among T$_{1}$, T$_{2}$ and T$_{3}$ are related?",
  "solution": "R = {(T$_{1}$, T$_{2}$): T$_{1}$ is similar to T$_{2}$}\n\nR is reflexive since every triangle is similar to itself.\n\nFurther, if (T$_{1}$, T$_{2}$) $\\in$ R, then T$_{1}$ is similar to T$_{2}$.\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ T$_{2}$ is similar to T$_{1}$.\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ (T$_{2}$, T$_{1}$) $\\in$ R\n\n$\\therefore$R is symmetric.\n\nNow, let (T$_{1}$, T$_{2}$), (T$_{2}$, T$_{3}$) $\\in$ R.\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ T$_{1}$ is similar to T$_{2}$ and T$_{2}$ is similar to T$_{3}$.\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ T$_{1}$ is similar to T$_{3}$.\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ (T$_{1}$, T$_{3}$) $\\in$ R\n\n$\\therefore$R is transitive.\n\nThus, R is an equivalence relation.\n\nNow, we can observe that:\n\n$\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n$\\therefore$The corresponding sides of triangles T$_{1}$ and T$_{3}$ are in the same ratio.\n\nThen, triangle T$_{1}$ is similar to triangle T$_{3}$.\n\nHence, T$_{1}$ is related to T$_{3}$."
