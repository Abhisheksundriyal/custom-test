  "question": "Show that the relation $R$ defined in the set $A$ of all polygons as $R = \\{(P_1, P_2): P_1 \\text{ and } P_2 \\text{ have same number of sides}\\} $, is an an equivalence relation. What is the set of all elements in $A$ related to the right angle triangle $T$ with sides $3, 4 \\text{ and } 5$?",
  "solution": "$R = \\{(P_1, P_2): P_1 \\text{ and } P_2 \\text{ have the same number of sides}\\} $\n\n$R$ is reflexive since $(P_1, P_1) \\in R$ as the same polygon has the same number of sides with itself.\n\nLet $(P_1, P_2) \\in R$.\n\n$\\Rightarrow P_1$ and $P_2$ have the same number of sides.\n\n$\\Rightarrow P_2$ and $P_1$ have the same number of sides.\n\n$\\Rightarrow (P_2, P_1) \\in R$\n\n$\\therefore R$ is symmetric.\n\nNow,\n\nLet $(P_1, P_2), (P_2, P_3) \\in R$.\n\n$\\Rightarrow P_1$ and $P_2$ have the same number of sides. Also, $P_2$ and $P_3$ have the same number of sides.\n\n$\\Rightarrow P_1$ and $P_3$ have the same number of sides.\n\n$\\Rightarrow (P_1, P_3) \\in R$\n\n$\\therefore R$ is transitive.\n\nHence, $R$ is an equivalence relation.\n\nThe elements in $A$ related to the right-angled triangle $(T)$ with sides $3, 4, \\text{ and } 5$ are those polygons which have $3$ sides (since $T$ is a polygon with $3$ sides).\n\nHence, the set of all elements in $A$ related to triangle $T$ is the set of all triangles."
