  "question": "Let $L$ be the set of all lines in XY plane and $R$ be the relation in $L$ defined as $R = \\{(L_1, L_2): L_1 \\text{ is parallel to } L_2\\}$. Show that $R$ is an equivalence relation. Find the set of all lines related to the line $y = 2x + 4$.",
  "solution": "$R = \\{(L_1, L_2): L_1 \\text{ is parallel to } L_2\\}$\n\n$R$ is reflexive as any line $L_1$ is parallel to itself i.e., $(L_1, L_1) \\in R$.\n\nNow,\n\nLet $(L_1, L_2) \\in R$.\n\n$\\Rightarrow L_1$ is parallel to $L_2$.\n\n$\\Rightarrow L_2$ is parallel to $L_1$.\n\n$\\Rightarrow (L_2, L_1) \\in R$\n\n$\\therefore R$ is symmetric.\n\nNow,\n\nLet $(L_1, L_2), (L_2, L_3) \\in R$.\n\n$\\Rightarrow L_1$ is parallel to $L_2$. Also, $L_2$ is parallel to $L_3$.\n\n$\\Rightarrow L_1$ is parallel to $L_3$.\n\n$\\therefore R$ is transitive.\n\nHence, $R$ is an equivalence relation.\n\nThe set of all lines related to the line $y = 2x + 4$ is the set of all lines that are parallel to the line $y = 2x + 4$.\n\nSlope of line $y = 2x + 4$ is $m = 2$\n\nIt is known that parallel lines have the same slopes.\n\nThe line parallel to the given line is of the form $y = 2x + c$, where $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nHence, the set of all lines related to the given line is given by $y = 2x + c$, where $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$."
