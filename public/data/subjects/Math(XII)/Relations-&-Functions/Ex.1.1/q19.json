  "question": "Let $R$ be the relation in the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ given by $R = \\{(1, 2), (2, 2), (1, 1), (4, 4), (1, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2)\\}$. Choose the correct answer.\n(A) $R$ is reflexive and symmetric but not transitive.\n(B) $R$ is reflexive and transitive but not symmetric.\n(C) $R$ is symmetric and transitive but not reflexive.\n(D) $R$ is an equivalence relation.",
  "solution": "$R = \\{(1, 2), (2, 2), (1, 1), (4, 4), (1, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2)\\}$\n\nIt is seen that $(a, a) \\in R$, for every $a \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\n$\\therefore R$ is reflexive.\n\nIt is seen that $(1, 2) \\in R$, but $(2, 1) \\notin R$.\n\n$\\therefore R$ is not symmetric.\n\nAlso, it is observed that $(a, b), (b, c) \\in R \\Rightarrow (a, c) \\in R$ for all $a, b, c \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\n$\\therefore R$ is transitive.\n\nHence, $R$ is reflexive and transitive but not symmetric.\n\nThe correct answer is B."
