  "question": "Determine whether each of the following relations are reflexive, symmetric and transitive:\n\n(v) Relation R in the set A of human beings in a town at a particular time given by\n\n(a) R = {(x, y): x and y work at the same place}\n\n(b) R = {(x, y): x and y live in the same locality}\n\n(c) R = {(x, y): x is exactly 7 cm taller than y}\n\n(d) R = {(x, y): x is wife of y}\n\n(e) R = {(x, y): x is father of y}",
  "solution": "(a) R = {(x, y): x and y work at the same place}\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ (x, x) $\\in$ R\n\n$\\therefore$R is reflexive.\n\nIf (x, y) $\\in$ R, then x and y work at the same place.\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ y and x work at the same place.\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ (y, x) $\\in$ R.\n\n$\\therefore$R is symmetric.\n\nNow, let (x, y), (y, z) $\\in$ R\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ x and y work at the same place and y and z work at the same place.\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ x and z work at the same place.\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ (x, z) $\\in$ R\n\n$\\therefore$ R is transitive.\n\nHence, R is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.\n\n(b) R = {(x, y): x and y live in the same locality}\n\nClearly (x, x) $\\in$ R as x and x is the same human being.\n\n$\\therefore$R is reflexive.\n\nIf (x, y) $\\in$ R, then x and y live in the same locality.\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ y and x live in the same locality.\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ (y, x) $\\in$ R\n\n$\\therefore$R is symmetric.\n\nNow, let (x, y) $\\in$ R and (y, z) $\\in$ R.\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ x and y live in the same locality and y and z live in the same locality.\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ x and z live in the same locality.\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ (x, z) $\\in$ R\n\n$\\therefore$ R is transitive.\n\n(c) R = {(x, y): x is exactly 7 cm taller than y}\n\nNow,\n\n(x, x) $\\notin$ R\n\nSince human being x cannot be taller than himself.\n\n$\\therefore$R is not reflexive.\n\nNow, let (x, y) $\\in$ R.\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ x is exactly 7 cm taller than y.\n\nThen, y is not taller than x.\n\n$\\therefore$ (y, x) $\\notin$ R\n\nIndeed if x is exactly 7 cm taller than y, then y is exactly 7 cm shorter than x.\n\n$\\therefore$R is not symmetric.\n\nNow,\n\nLet (x, y), (y, z) $\\in$ R.\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ x is exactly 7 cm taller than y and y is exactly 7 cm taller than z.\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ x is exactly 14 cm taller than z .\n\n$\\therefore$ (x, z) $\\notin$ R\n\n$\\therefore$ R is not transitive.\n\nHence, R is neither reflexive, nor symmetric, nor transitive.\n\n(d) R = {(x, y): x is the wife of y}\n\nNow,\n\n(x, x) $\\notin$ R\n\nSince x cannot be the wife of herself.\n\n$\\therefore$R is not reflexive.\n\nNow, let (x, y) $\\in$ R.\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ x is the wife of y.\n\nClearly y is not the wife of x.\n\n$\\therefore$(y, x) $\\notin$ R\n\nIndeed if x is the wife of y, then y is the husband of x.\n\n$\\therefore$ R is not transitive.\n\nLet (x, y), (y, z) $\\in$ R\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ x is the wife of y and y is the wife of z.\n\nThis case is not possible. Also, this does not imply that x is the wife of z.\n\n$\\therefore$(x, z) $\\notin$ R\n\n$\\therefore$R is not transitive.\n\nHence, R is neither reflexive, nor symmetric, nor transitive.\n\n(e) R = {(x, y): x is the father of y}\n\n(x, x) $\\notin$ R\n\nAs x cannot be the father of himself.\n\n$\\therefore$R is not reflexive.\n\nNow, let (x, y) $\\in$ R.\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ x is the father of y.\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ y cannot be the father of y.\n\nIndeed, y is the son or the daughter of y.\n\n$\\therefore$(y, x) $\\notin$ R\n\n$\\therefore$ R is not symmetric.\n\nNow, let (x, y) $\\in$ R and (y, z) $\\in$ R.\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ x is the father of y and y is the father of z.\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ x is not the father of z.\n\nIndeed x is the grandfather of z.\n\n$\\therefore$ (x, z) $\\notin$ R\n\n$\\therefore$R is not transitive.\n\nHence, R is neither reflexive, nor symmetric, nor transitive."
