  "question": "Check whether the relation R defined in the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} as R = {(a, b): b = a + 1} is reflexive, symmetric or transitive.",
  "solution": "Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nA relation R is defined on set A as:\n\nR = {(a, b): b = a + 1}\n\n$\\therefore$R = {(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6)}\n\nWe can find (a, a) $\\notin$ R, where a $\\in$ A.\n\nFor instance,\n\n(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6) $\\notin$ R\n\n$\\therefore$R is not reflexive.\n\nIt can be observed that (1, 2) $\\in$ R, but (2, 1) $\\notin$ R.\n\n$\\therefore$R is not symmetric.\n\nNow, (1, 2), (2, 3) $\\in$ R\n\nBut,\n\n(1, 3) $\\notin$ R\n\n$\\therefore$R is not transitive\n\nHence, R is neither reflexive, nor symmetric, nor transitive."
