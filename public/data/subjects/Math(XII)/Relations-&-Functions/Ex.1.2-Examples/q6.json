  "question": "Show that $f: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$, given by\n$$f(x)=\\begin{cases}x+1,&\\text{if } x \\text{ is odd}\\\\x-1,&\\text{if } x \\text{ is even}\\end{cases}$$\nis both one-one and onto.",
  "solution": "Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. \n\nNote that if $x_1$ is odd and $x_2$ is even, then we will have $x_1 + 1 = x_2 - 1$, i.e., $x_2 - x_1 = 2$ which is impossible. \n\nSimilarly, the possibility of $x_1$ being even and $x_2$ being odd can also be ruled out, using the similar argument. Therefore, both $x_1$ and $x_2$ must be either odd or even. \n\nSuppose both $x_1$ and $x_2$ are odd. Then $f(x_1) = f(x_2) \\Rightarrow x_1 + 1 = x_2 + 1 \\Rightarrow x_1 = x_2$. \n\nSimilarly, if both $x_1$ and $x_2$ are even, then also $f(x_1) = f(x_2) \\Rightarrow x_1 - 1 = x_2 - 1 \\Rightarrow x_1 = x_2$. \n\nThus, $f$ is one-one. \n\nAlso, any odd number $2r + 1$ in the co-domain $\\mathbb{N}$ is the image of $2r + 2$ in the domain $\\mathbb{N}$ and any even number $2r$ in the co-domain $\\mathbb{N}$ is the image of $2r - 1$ in the domain $\\mathbb{N}$. \n\nThus, $f$ is onto."
