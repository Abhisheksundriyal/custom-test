  "question": "Show that the function $f: \\mathbb{R}_\\ast \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_\\ast$ defined by $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x}$ is one-one and onto, where $\\mathbb{R}_\\ast$ is the set of all non-zero real numbers. Is the result true, if the domain $\\mathbb{R}_\\ast$ is replaced by $\\mathbb{N}$ with co-domain being same as $\\mathbb{R}_\\ast$?",
  "solution": "It is given that $f: \\mathbb{R}_\\ast \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_\\ast$ is defined by $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x}$.\n\nOne-one:\n\n$f(x) = f(y)$\n\n$\\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{1}{y}$\n\n$\\Rightarrow x = y$.\n\n$\\therefore f$ is one-one.\n\nOnto:\n\nIt is clear that for $y \\in \\mathbb{R}_\\ast$, there exists $x = \\frac{1}{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}_\\ast$ (Exists as $y \\neq 0$) such that\n\n$f\\left(\\frac{1}{y}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{1}{y}\\right)} = y$.\n\n$\\therefore f$ is onto.\n\nThus, the given function $(f)$ is one-one and onto.\n\nNow, consider function $g: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_\\ast$ defined by\n\n$g(x) = \\frac{1}{x}$.\n\nWe have,\n\n$g(x_1) = g(x_2) \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{x_1} = \\frac{1}{x_2} \\Rightarrow x_1 = x_2$\n\n$\\therefore g$ is one-one.\n\nFurther, it is clear that $g$ is not onto as for $1.2 \\in \\mathbb{R}_\\ast$, there does not exist any $x$ in $\\mathbb{N}$ such that $g(x) = 1.2$.\n\nHence, function $g$ is one-one but not onto."
