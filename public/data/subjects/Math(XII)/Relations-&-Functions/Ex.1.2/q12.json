  "question": "In each of the following cases, state whether the function is one-one, onto or bijective.\nJustify your answer.\n(ii) $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ defined as $f(x) = 1 + x^2$",
  "solution": "(ii) $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is defined as\n$f(x) = 1 + x^2$.\n\nLet $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$.\n\n$\\Rightarrow 1 + x_1^2 = 1 + x_2^2$\n\n$\\Rightarrow x_1^2 = x_2^2$\n\n$\\Rightarrow x_1 = \\pm x_2$\n\n$\\therefore f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ does not imply that $x_1 = x_2$.\n\nFor instance,\n\n$f(1) = f(-1) = 2$\n\n$\\therefore f$ is not one-one.\n\nConsider an element $-2$ in co-domain $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nIt is seen that $f(x) = 1 + x^2$ is positive for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThus, there does not exist any $x$ in domain $\\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x) = -2$.\n\n$\\therefore f$ is not onto.\n\nHence, $f$ is neither one-one nor onto."
