  "question": "Check the injectivity and surjectivity of the following functions:\n(i) $f: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ given by $f(x) = x^2$",
  "solution": "(i) $f: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ is given by,\n$f(x) = x^2$\n\nIt is seen that for $x, y \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $f(x) = f(y) \\Rightarrow x^2 = y^2 \\Rightarrow x = y$.\n\n$\\therefore f$ is injective.\n\nNow, $2 \\in \\mathbb{N}$. But, there does not exist any $x$ in $\\mathbb{N}$ such that $f(x) = x^2 = 2$.\n\n$\\therefore f$ is not surjective.\n\nHence, function $f$ is injective but not surjective."
