  "question": "Check the injectivity and surjectivity of the following functions:\n(ii) $f: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}$ is given by, $f(x) = x^2$",
  "solution": "(ii) $f: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}$ is given by,\n$f(x) = x^2$\n\nIt is seen that $f(-1) = f(1) = 1$, but $-1 \\neq 1$.\n\n$\\therefore f$ is not injective.\n\nNow, $-2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. But, there does not exist any element $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $f(x) = x^2 = -2$.\n\n$\\therefore f$ is not surjective.\n\nHence, function $f$ is neither injective nor surjective."
