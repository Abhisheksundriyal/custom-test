  "question": "Check the injectivity and surjectivity of the following functions:\n(v) $f: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}$ given by $f(x) = x^3$",
  "solution": "(v) $f: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}$ is given by,\n\n$f(x) = x^3$\n\nIt is seen that for $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, $f(x) = f(y) \\Rightarrow x^3 = y^3 \\Rightarrow x = y$.\n\n$\\therefore f$ is injective.\n\nNow, $2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. But, there does not exist any element $x$ in domain $\\mathbb{Z}$ such that $f(x) = x^3 = 2$.\n\n$\\therefore f$ is not surjective.\n\nHence, function $f$ is injective but not surjective."
