  "question": "Show that the number of equivalence relation in the set $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$ containing $(1, 2)$ and $(2, 1)$ is two.",
  "solution": "The smallest equivalence relation $R_1$ containing $(1, 2)$ and $(2, 1)$ is $\\{\\{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1)\\}\\}$.\n\nNow we are left with only 4 pairs namely $(2, 3)$, $(3, 2)$, $(1, 3)$ and $(3, 1)$.\n\nIf we add any one, say $(2, 3)$ to $R_1$, then for symmetry we must add $(3, 2)$ also and now for transitivity we are forced to add $(1, 3)$ and $(3, 1)$.\n\nThus, the only equivalence relation bigger than $R_1$ is the universal relation.\n\nThis shows that the total number of equivalence relations containing $(1, 2)$ and $(2, 1)$ is two."
